      <ul
    />
    <li>Generously rub two disposable foil pie pans with vegan butter.</li>
    <li>
      In a large bowl, whisk together the almond milk, melted butter, and sugar.
      The mixture should be just warm, registering between 100-110˚F (37-43˚C).
      If it is hotter, allow to cool slightly.
    </li>
    <li>
      Sprinkle the yeast evenly over the warm mixture and let set for 1 minute.
      Add 5 cups flour and 1 teaspoon of salt to the milk mixture and mix with a
      wooden spoon until just combined.
    </li>
    <li>
      Cover the bowl with a towel or plastic wrap and set in a warm place to
      rise for 1 hour. Preheat oven to 350˚F (180˚C).
    </li>
    <li>
      After 1 hour, the dough should have nearly doubled in size. Remove the
      towel and add an additional ½ cup (95g) of flour and salt. Stir well, then
      turn out onto a well-floured surface.
    </li>
    <li>
      Knead the dough lightly, adding additional flour as necessary, until the
      dough just loses its stickiness and does not stick to the surface. Roll
      the dough out into a large rectangle, about ½-inch (1 cm) thick. Fix
      corners to make sure they are sharp and even.
    </li>
    <li>
      Spread the softened vegan butter evenly over the dough. Sprinkle evenly
      with brown sugar and cinnamon.
    </li>
    <li>
      Roll up the dough, forming a log, and pinch the seam closed. Place
      seam-side down. Trim off any unevenness on either end. Cut the log in
      half, then divide each half into 7 evenly sized pieces. About 1½ inches (8
      cm) thick each.
    </li>
    <li>
      Place 7 cinnamon rolls in each cake pan, one in the center, six around the
      sides. Cover with plastic wrap and place in a warm place to rise for 30
      minutes.
    </li>
    <li>
      To prepare the frosting. In a medium-size mixing bowl, whisk together
      powdered sugar, almond milk, and vanilla until smooth.
    </li>
    <li>
      Remove plastic wrap. Bake the cinnamon rolls in a preheated oven at 350˚F
      (180˚C) for 25-30 minutes, until golden brown.
    </li>
    <li>While still warm, drizzle evenly with frosting</li>
